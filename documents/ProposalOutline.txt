Intro to Problem
  What are starspots?
    Cooler areas on the "surface" (photosphere) of a star
    Caused by internal magnetic field penetrating surface
    On Sun, vary over an 11-year cycle
    Solar activity (flares, etc.) tends to occur at or near spots
  Why do we care about starspots?
    Internal magnetic fields of s tarts not fully understood (dynamo theory)
    In general, most stellar data comes from the Sun
    Starspots could provide info about MF of other stars
    Also give clear indication of rotation rate
  What is our data & How can we use it to find starspots?
    Cannot resolve positional information of (non-Sun) stars
    Kepler continually measures light intensity of many stars
    Periodic (brief) dimming used to infer planet revolution
    Longer-scale variation ("lightcurve") used to infer spots
  Specific parameters
    stellar inclination (affects visible area) - semi-degenerate with latitude
    limb-darkening coefficients - taken as fixed [justification?]
    number of spots
    spot radius & position (latitude & longitude)
    spot contrast - degenerate with radius (taken as fixed)
    Differential rotation
    
Previous Work
  Ancient History
    Ismael Boulliau first (incorrectly) proposed starspot hypothesis (1667)
    Gerald Kron first modern data of light variability (1947)
    Proposed startspots (correctly) but largely ignored 'til 1960s-70s
    Several other methods used for detecting spots (Doppler, eclipse mapping, LDR)
  Mathematics - Generating lightcurve from spot parameters
    Integrate specific intensity over visible area
    Several analytic formulations (circular spots) - we use Eker 1994
    Numerical models also used, but problematic for fitting
  Fitting - Estimating spot parameters from lightcurve
    Ribarik et al 2002 - SpotModeL - Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm
    Croll 2006 - Starspotz - Added MCMC algorithm
    Graphics & Visualization tie these programs to C & Visual C++
    We want more accessible treatment for high-throughput analysis
    [Any other differences between us & previous work?]

Our Goals
  Implement Eker equations for lightcurve generation in Python (done)
  Start by implementing L-M nonlinear least squares
  Try several fitting algorithms (gradient methods) for better performance
  Such methods only give local optima; try MCMC for more thorough traversal of param space
  Provide method of determining appropriate number of spots
  Also consider HOW multispot fitting is done
  Start modeling stars with some known parameters (eg. inclination) from other sources
  Finally, apply to large set of Kepler, trying to draw general conclusions
